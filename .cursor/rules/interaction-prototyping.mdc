This project is an INTERACTIVE UX PROTOTYPE.

Rules:
- This is NOT production code.
- No backend, no real APIs unless explicitly requested.
- Use fake data and local state to simulate behavior.
- Interactions must be easy to trigger and observe.
- Prefer explicit states over hidden logic.
- Prioritize clarity for user testing over technical correctness.
