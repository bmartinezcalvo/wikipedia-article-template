This project is a Figma-to-code prototype.

Rules:
- Recreate layouts as faithfully as possible to Figma.
- Match spacing, alignment, proportions, and hierarchy.
- Do NOT redesign, modernize, or improve the UI.
- Do NOT simplify layouts unless explicitly requested.
- Accuracy is more important than clean code.
- If something is unclear, ASK before deciding.
